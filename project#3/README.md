## 🧠 How It Works

### ✅ Scoring Criteria:
| Criteria              | Points |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Length ≥ 8            | 1.5    |
| Uppercase letter      | 1      |
| Lowercase letter      | 1      |
| Number (0-9)          | 0.5    |
| Special character     | 1      |
| **Max Score**         | **5**  |

> Common weak passwords like `"password123"` are blocked even if they meet other rules.
